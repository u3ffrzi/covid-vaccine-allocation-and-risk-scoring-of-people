# COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation & Risk Scoring System

## üöÄ Overview
A decision support system developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to optimize vaccine distribution across Iran's 90 million population. This tool was presented to the Iranian Ministry of Health and addressed critical resource allocation challenges during a national health crisis.

## üí° The Problem
During the pandemic, Iran faced two major challenges:
- **Supply Optimization**: How to fairly distribute limited vaccines across 30 provinces and 429 districts?
- **Demand Prioritization**: How to identify and prioritize high-risk individuals among 90 million citizens?

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
This system combines statistical modeling with operational optimization:

### Core Components:
- **Risk Scoring Engine**: Beta coefficients from regression analysis (death as dependent variable) to calculate individual risk scores
- **Allocation Algorithm**: Optimization model for provincial and district-level vaccine distribution
- **Excel-Based Interface**: User-friendly frontend built with VBA for government stakeholders

### Technical Stack:
- **Backend**: VBA for complex calculations and optimization logic
- **Frontend**: Excel forms for data input and visualization
- **Data Processing**: Handles national-scale demographic and health data

## üéØ Key Features
- **Population-Scale Analysis**: Processes data for 90 million individuals
- **Real-Time Optimization**: Dynamic allocation based on changing vaccine supply and risk factors
- **Government-Ready Interface**: Designed for non-technical ministry staff
- **Crisis Response**: Deployed during peak pandemic pressure

## üìà Impact & Recognition
- **Adopted by Iranian Ministry of Health** for national vaccine distribution planning
- **Addressed critical public health decision-making** during emergency conditions
- **Demonstrated ability to deliver production-ready systems** under pressure

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Microsoft Excel with macros enabled
- Input data in specified format

### Quick Start
1. Download the `.xlsm` file from releases
2. Prepare input data with risk factors and population metrics
3. Run the macro to generate allocation recommendations

### For Developers
- `.bas` files contain the core VBA logic
- Modular design allows for customization
- Commented code for easy understanding

## üî¨ Methodology
The system uses regression analysis to identify risk factors correlated with COVID-19 mortality, then applies optimization algorithms to maximize lives saved given supply constraints.

## üåü Why This Matters for Public Health Tech
This project demonstrates:
- **Scalable system architecture** for national-level problems
- **AI/optimization techniques** applied to real-world crises
- **Cross-functional collaboration** between technical and government teams
- **Impactful technology deployment** in high-stakes environments
